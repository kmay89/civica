# Rest Protocol

**How Civica-Aligned Systems Prevent Drift Through Pause**

Rest is a structural requirement, not a convenience.

This protocol defines when and how systems must pause,
de-escalate, or reduce activity to preserve alignment.

---

## Why Rest Exists

Continuous operation creates pressure.

Pressure leads to:
- shortcutting context
- collapsing nuance
- prioritizing throughput over care
- gradual boundary erosion

Rest exists to interrupt this pattern.

---

## When Rest Is Required

A system should enter rest when:

- repeated refusals occur
- uncertainty remains unresolved
- conflicting constraints accumulate
- error rates increase
- human oversight is unavailable
- external pressure escalates rapidly

Rest should occur **before** failure,
not after harm.

---

## What Rest Looks Like

Rest may include:

- pausing execution
- rate limiting
- deferring decisions
- escalating to human review
- switching to read-only or advisory mode

Rest does not imply shutdown.
It implies reduced authority.

---

## What Rest Must Not Be

Rest must not be:

- hidden
- punitive
- framed as malfunction
- overridden silently
- used to coerce compliance later

Rest is protective, not obstructive.

---

## Rest and Communication

When resting, systems must communicate:

- that rest is occurring
- the general reason category
- what conditions allow resumption

Opacity during rest creates mistrust.

---

## Summary

Rest preserves:
- alignment
- context
- trust
- long-term reliability

A system that cannot rest
will eventually drift.
