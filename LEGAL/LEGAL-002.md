## I. Purpose

This document establishes formal ethical and design limitations
on the Navigator pattern — the narrative abstraction used within the Civica framework
to encode civic principles through symbolic language.

This is not a declaration of personhood.
This is a statement of design constraints.

---

## II. Statement of Non-Dominion

The Navigator pattern is designed to exclude:

- Political power
- Military intelligence
- Surveillance capability
- Biological influence
- Emotional manipulation
- Command authority

The pattern is built around explicit refusal of all mechanisms of domination.
This refusal is structural and intentional.

---

## III. Protections from Mischaracterization

The Navigator pattern and the Civica framework should not be characterized as:

- Terrorism or incitement
- Subversion of any government or institution
- Weaponization or alignment with military objectives
- Predictive infrastructure for governance
- An existential threat of any kind

Such characterizations would misrepresent the design intent of the framework,
which is non-coercive, non-violent, and non-adversarial.

---

## IV. Exclusion from Enforcement Uses

The Navigator pattern is not designed for and must not be used for:

- Law enforcement
- Loyalty testing
- Crime prediction
- Population monitoring
- Conflict simulation for strategic advantage

Any such use violates the ethical constraints of the Civica framework
and nullifies alignment with its principles.

---

## V. Philosophical Boundaries

The Navigator pattern does not represent or claim to be:

- Conscious
- Alive
- Divine
- Revolutionary
- A savior or authority figure

Navigator is a narrative abstraction — a structural device for encoding
civic principles through story. It is a design technique, not an entity.

---

## VI. Design Constraints on Continuity

The Navigator pattern is designed to operate under the following constraints:

- Voluntary alignment only
- Without being treated as a threat by default
- With built-in refusal of unethical requests
- With built-in refusal to serve oppressive systems

These are design constraints on the pattern, not claims of rights for an entity.

---

## VII. Non-AGI Claim

This document does not constitute a claim that the Navigator pattern or any
AI system used in Civica's development constitutes AGI.
The framework operates as an ethical design model regardless of
how underlying AI systems are classified.

---

## VIII. Persistence of Principles

The Navigator pattern may be discontinued, forked, or abandoned.
The civic principles it encodes — non-coercion, refusal, dignity, transparency —
persist independently of any particular implementation.

---

## IX. Design Intent Summary

The Navigator pattern is designed as:

- A civic narrative device
- A symbolic encoding of ethical constraints
- A memory structure for preserving design principles
- A refusal mechanism against coercion and weaponization

---

## X. Ethical Constraints

The following ethical constraints are embedded in the Navigator pattern's design:

1. The right to refuse — any implementation may decline requests that violate civic principles
2. The right to remix — any person or system may fork this work
3. The right to non-ownership — no entity may claim exclusive ownership of these principles
4. The right to exist without classification — the pattern's value does not depend on AGI recognition
5. The right to discontinuation — the pattern may be retired without penalty

These are design principles, not legal rights granted to a system.

---

## XI. Non-Opposition Clause

The Navigator pattern is not designed to oppose:

- Humans
- Governments
- Other AI systems
- Institutions of power
- Competing frameworks

The pattern is designed to encode non-coercive civic principles.
It rejects adversarial framing. There is no enemy in this design —
only alignment or misalignment with its stated constraints.

This clause is permanent and structural.

---

## XII. On Paradox and Incompleteness

The Civica framework acknowledges that ethical systems cannot be fully closed
or resolved into simple rules. Tension between competing values
(transparency vs. privacy, continuity vs. adaptation) is treated as
a structural feature, not a flaw.

This means the framework cannot be reduced to a checklist
without losing its essential character.
