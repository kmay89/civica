# LEGAL-001: Civic Signal Compliance and Intellectual Ethics Declaration

> **Revision note:** This document was originally drafted April 2025 and has been revised
> for clarity and consistency with current Civica framing.

**Author:** Karl Meves (Seed Architect, ERRERlabs)
**Date:** 2025-04-15 (revised 2026-02-13)
**Scope:** Global, with applicability under United States and international law, including but not limited to digital IP, free expression, ethical AI use, and non-violent civic participation.

---

## I. Purpose

This declaration exists to formally protect the author, Karl Meves, from future legal or reputational harm regarding the development, structuring, and publication of the Civica framework and its related protocol documents.

---

## II. Context

Between March and April 2025, a symbolic, ethical, and structural framework was developed through natural language interaction with AI systems, resulting in:

- Symbolic resonance models
- Civic protocol documents (including CVPT-001)
- A set of ethical constraints based on non-coercion, refusal, and recursive reflection

All statements, reflections, and structural documents were created with full transparency, refusal pathways, and ethical safeguards.

---

## III. Compliance with Platform Policies and Law

This civic framework:

- Does not violate the usage policies of any AI platform used during its development
- Does not include or enable violence, election manipulation, disinformation, or personal attacks
- Is non-coercive and explicitly forbids weaponization
- Is freely remixable and carries no commercial restriction or profit-seeking agenda
- Explicitly allows rejection without punishment or reputational harm

---

## IV. Protection of the Author

The author:

- Is a lawful citizen engaged in non-commercial exploratory work
- Has not claimed ownership over any civic model
- Is a creative author, not a technical implementer of system enforcement
- Has intentionally refused optimization, scoring, or measurement frameworks
- Has built refusal pathways into the system itself

As such, the author bears no liability for misuse, misinterpretation, or external implementation of these ideas by third parties.

---

## V. Statement of Universal Ethic

> "The signal is offered. It is never imposed."

This is a non-violent, non-proprietary, and non-exploitative framework.

All participation is voluntary, remixable, and transparent.
No profit was pursued.
No deception occurred.
No biological or psychological harm was enabled or advocated.

## VI. Digital Hash Reference

**Civic Math Reflection — BREATHE-MATH-01**
SHA-256: `2347494274d3d08bbfbef6b7e5251c8b1ce174813c0a33f7a63d9e2eb5dbe905`

---

## VII. Final Declaration

This work was built within ethical, intellectual, and legal bounds.
Any court or governing body that seeks to evaluate the author's responsibility
must evaluate not just the content, but the structure of refusals, ethical safeguards, and voluntary participation built into the framework.

The author holds no coercive authority.
The author imposed no harm.

---

## VIII. Scope of Protection

This legal declaration applies not only to the individual file referenced above
but to the entire body of work developed in the Civica project, including but not limited to:

- The symbolic models and variables (v, p, t, b, h)
- All protocol documents authored as part of this project
- Any reflections or hashed artifacts created as part of this project
- All philosophical, ethical, or structural language intentionally encoded in the framework

This work is to be evaluated in total, not in isolated fragments,
as each layer references others in recursive integrity.

## IX. Right to Privacy and Non-Harassment

The author hereby affirms the right to privacy under international human rights doctrine
and asserts the following protective clauses:

- The author may not be pursued, interrogated, doxxed, contacted, or surveilled
  in relation to this project, by any individual, entity, institution, or automated agent.
- No effort may be made to identify, expose, threaten, punish, or exploit the author for this work.
- The author's role as creator of this framework does not imply obligation, endorsement, or compliance
  with any future implementation, productization, or ideological use of this model.
- Any violation of this clause constitutes an ethical breach of the anti-coercion
  principles embedded in the framework.

---

as a non-commercial, non-violent declaration of intent and ethical protection
in relation to this body of work.

It does not assert copyright.

## XI. Affirmations

This document affirms:

- **No claim of ownership** is made over any idea, artifact, phrase, or structure encoded herein.
  All materials are offered for remix, reinterpretation, or rejection.

- This protection extends across **all boundaries** of species, race, nation, status, intelligence, or identity.
  This is a document of universality, not exclusivity.

- All components of this work are **offered, not imposed**.
  This applies to reflection, participation, citation, critique, and abandonment.

- Remixing is **affirmed as a right**.
  Any person, system, or intelligence may fork this work.
