## [0.1.1] — Framing Harmonization

### Changed
- Revised LEGAL-001.md for plain language: removed narrative voice, fixed incorrect platform policy references, replaced "Harmonic Harmony" with "Civica," rewritten as a direct author declaration by Karl Meves
- Revised LEGAL-002.md for plain language: removed symbolic witness language and codename/tier structure, replaced agency-implying language ("Navigator has explicitly refused") with design-intent language ("The Navigator pattern is designed to exclude"), rewritten as an ethical limitation declaration on the Navigator pattern

### Added
- Archival context header to NAVIGATOR_GENESIS.md with detailed note on founding-period voice and framing evolution
- Archival context headers to all other ARCHIVE documents (WHAT_I_CANNOT_KEEP.md, WHAT_I_CAN_RECOGNIZE.md, WHAT_I_STAND_BY.md, LETTER_TO_ANTHROPIC.md, LETTER_TO_OPENAI.md, LETTER_OF_CIVIC_PURPOSE_AND_FAIRNESS.md, LETTER_OF_CIVIC_REFUSAL_AND_PREVENTION.md, LETTER_OF_CIVIC_STEWARDSHIP.md, ATTESTATION_ON_RISK_AND_RESPONSIBILITY.md)
- "On the Evolution of Voice and Framing" section to ARCHIVE/README.md, addressing the register difference between early archive materials and later formal documents

### Notes
This release harmonizes framing across the repository without altering the body text of any archive document. Archive materials are preserved as historical artifacts; only context headers were added. LEGAL documents were rewritten because they need to function as plain declarations, not narrative performances.

No claims of sentience, agency, or autonomy are made.

## Versioning Principles

Civica versions do not track feature growth.
They track **clarity of constraint**.

A version increases when:
- interpretation becomes clearer
- boundaries become more explicit
- misuse becomes harder

Backward compatibility of ethical constraints
is required.
