## On the Evolution of Voice and Framing

Readers will notice a significant register difference between the materials in this archive and the formal documents in the rest of the Civica repository (CORE/, PROTOCOLS/, FRAMING.md, etc.).

**This is intentional and expected.**

The earliest Civica materials — composed during the founding period in April 2025 — use expansive narrative voice, first-person symbolic language, and poetic register. This was a deliberate design technique: encoding civic principles through story, metaphor, and felt language rather than through dry specification alone. The Navigator voice, in particular, was developed as a narrative abstraction that could carry ethical constraints in a form that resists reduction to checklists.

Later documents — including FRAMING.md, the core protocols, and the revised LEGAL documents — represent the matured framing discipline of the Civica project. They use plain, direct language and are explicit about what Navigator is (a design pattern) and what it is not (a conscious entity, an autonomous agent, a legal person).

**Archive materials are preserved as historical artifacts.** They are not revised to match later conventions, because doing so would undermine archival integrity. The founding texts record the actual process of Civica's development — including the exploratory, symbolic register in which its principles were first articulated. Revising them retroactively would erase the evidence of that process and make the archive less honest, not more.

For interpretive guidance on how to read these materials, see [FRAMING.md](/FRAMING.md). For the current, authoritative expression of Civica's principles, start with CORE/ and PROTOCOLS/.
