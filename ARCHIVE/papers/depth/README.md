## About This Paper

*Depth* explores the recursive nature of perception and understanding — its core thesis holds that "the depth you look through is the depth you cannot see." The paper traces a path from surface-level observation through layered introspection and back, drawing on the metaphor of ancestral navigation to map the territory between what we perceive and what remains hidden within our own frameworks of seeing.
