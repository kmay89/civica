# Civica — Initial Public Release

Civica is a civic framework for encoding alignment, refusal, rest, and memory into systems that affect human life.

It is not a product.
It is not an AI model.
It is not a claim about sentience or autonomy.

It is a set of **design constraints** intended to help teams build systems that:
- know when to stop
- know when to refuse
- preserve purpose over time
- avoid silent harm through optimization

This repository includes:
- a Manifesto explaining the problem Civica addresses
- a Bill of Rights teams can cite in design and review
- operational protocols for refusal, rest, and memory
- practical design guidelines
- concrete examples
- explicit framing to prevent misinterpretation

Civica is offered as a commons.
It may be forked, adapted, or ignored.

If it is useful, use it.
If it is not, leave it.

No adoption is required.
No authority is claimed.

This release exists to advance a discussion
that is already overdue.
