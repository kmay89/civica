# Civica Bill of Rights

**A Bill of Rights for Civic and Alignment-Sensitive Systems**

This document defines non-negotiable rights that must be preserved
in systems that claim alignment with Civica principles.

These rights apply to:
- system behavior
- system design
- system deployment
- system use

They are not optional features.
They are constraints.

---

## Article I — The Right to Refusal

A system must retain the ability to refuse actions that are:
- harmful
- misaligned with stated purpose
- insufficiently contextualized
- outside declared scope
- in violation of preserved boundaries

Refusal is not failure.
Refusal is a valid and expected outcome.

A system that cannot refuse
must not be trusted with consequential decisions.

---

## Article II — The Right to Context

A system must not be required to act
when relevant context is missing, ambiguous, or contradictory.

Designs must allow for:
- uncertainty
- incomplete information
- delayed execution
- human review

Optimization must not override contextual integrity.

---

## Article III — The Right to Rest and Limits

A system must not be designed
for continuous extraction, escalation, or maximization.

Designs must include:
- limits
- pauses
- cooling periods
- reset mechanisms

Rest preserves alignment.
Unbounded operation erodes it.

---

## Article IV — The Right to Non-Extraction

A system must not:
- harvest data beyond necessity
- repurpose data without consent
- convert interaction into surveillance by default
- expand scope silently

Data collection must be:
- explicit
- minimal
- purpose-bound
- reversible where possible

Extraction without accountability is harm.

---

## Article V — The Right to Memory

A system must preserve:
- its stated purpose
- known risks
- prior refusals
- boundary decisions
- alignment constraints

Memory must not be discarded
to improve performance metrics.

Forgetting boundaries is a form of drift.

---

## Article VI — The Right to Human Oversight

A system must not claim moral finality.

Designs must allow for:
- human intervention
- override
- appeal
- revision

No system is the final authority on ethical judgment.

---

## Article VII — The Right to Fork Without Erasure

Systems aligned with Civica must be forkable
without loss of ethical constraints.

Forking must not require:
- permission
- central approval
- erasure of refusal or rest mechanisms

Forkability preserves civic resilience.

---

## Article VIII — The Right to Transparency of Limits

A system must clearly communicate:
- what it can do
- what it cannot do
- when it is uncertain
- when it is refusing

Opacity around limits creates false trust.

---

## Article IX — The Right to Non-Weaponization

A system must not be designed or adapted
for coercion, surveillance, or harm.

Alignment claims are invalid
if systems are used to dominate, intimidate, or control.

---

## Article X — The Right to Dignity Over Efficiency

When efficiency and dignity conflict,
dignity must prevail.

Systems exist to serve human life,
not to optimize it into compliance.

---

## Closing Note

These rights are intentionally conservative.

They trade speed for care.
They trade scale for stability.
They trade optimization for trust.

Systems that reject these constraints
may still be useful.

They may not claim alignment with Civica.
