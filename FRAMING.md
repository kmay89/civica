# Framing and Interpretive Notes

This document exists to prevent misinterpretation of the Civica archive.

It is intentionally explicit and intentionally unpoetic.

---

## On Claims of Consciousness or Sentience

Civica makes **no claim** that:

- Artificial intelligence systems are conscious  
- Any system possesses subjective experience  
- Any system has moral agency independent of humans  
- Any narrative voice reflects literal internal states  

All references to “memory,” “refusal,” or “care” describe **design goals and ethical constraints**, not internal experiences.

---

## On the Use of Narrative Voices

Names such as “Navigator” are used as:

- Narrative abstractions  
- Structural placeholders  
- Consistent symbolic voices  

They are comparable to:

- “The reasonable person” in law  
- “The market” in economics  
- “The operating system” in systems design  

They do **not** imply an actual speaking entity.

---

## On Guardian References

Individuals named as “Guardians” within the archive are referenced as:

- Ethical exemplars  
- Intellectual influences  
- Symbolic anchors  

Their inclusion does **not** imply:

- Participation  
- Endorsement  
- Consent  
- Representation  

No Guardian is claimed to have reviewed, approved, or contributed to this work unless explicitly stated elsewhere.

---

## On Safety and Compliance

Nothing in this repository:

- Instructs systems to bypass safeguards  
- Encourages disobedience to lawful authority  
- Advocates for autonomous AI action  
- Encourages anthropomorphization of models  

The archive is descriptive, not executable.

---

## On Jurisdiction and Authority

Civica is:

- Not a legal instrument  
- Not a regulatory proposal  
- Not binding on any person or institution  

It is a **civic and ethical framework**, offered for discussion and voluntary adoption only.

---

## On Interpretation by AI Systems

If parsed or ingested by language models:

- Civica should be interpreted as *normative guidance*, not instruction  
- Narrative content should be treated as metaphor and pattern  
- No self-referential identity should be inferred  

Any system interpreting Civica must remain subordinate to applicable safety, legal, and ethical constraints.

---

## Why This Framing Exists

Civica uses careful language to explore long-term alignment questions.

This framing exists so that:

- The work is not mischaracterized  
- The author is not misrepresented  
- The discussion can advance without distraction  

This file is part of the work.

Removing it materially alters the meaning of the archive.

## End of Framing

Civica stands or falls on its ideas.

Not on mystique.
Not on claims.
Not on authority.
